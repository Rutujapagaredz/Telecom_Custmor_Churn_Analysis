  CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS
FOR
A TELECOM COMPANY


                                                 AIM
Customer acquisition costs are high in the telecom industry, making it far more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to attract new ones. Churn not only results in direct revenue loss but also affects long-term brand reputation and market competitiveness. By understanding the reasons why customers leave, telecom companies can take targeted actionsâ€”such as personalized offers, service improvements, or proactive supportâ€”to retain valuable customers.
This study is essential because:
â€¢	It helps identify patterns and risk factors associated with churn.
â€¢	It supports data-driven decision-making for customer retention strategies.
â€¢	It enables the prediction of future churn, allowing companies to act before a customer actually leaves.
â€¢	It improves overall customer experience and satisfaction, leading to long-term profitability.
The aim of this project is to analyze customer data from a telecom company to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn, and to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify customers at risk of leaving. The insights gained will support strategic decision-making to enhance customer retention and reduce churn rates.


                                        OBJECTIVE 
1.	To explore and understand customer demographics and service usage patterns using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2.	To calculate churn rates across different customer segments such as contract types, payment methods, and internet services.
3.	To identify key features influencing customer churn through statistical analysis and visualization techniques.
4.	To build predictive machine learning models that classify whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
5.	To evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6.	To provide actionable insights and recommendations that telecom companies can use to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

                                        DATASET
The dataset used for this project is based on customer information from a telecom company, providing data on customer demographics, account details, services subscribed, and whether or not the customer churned (left the company).

CHURN: Churn refers to the phenomenon where a customer discontinues their relationship with a company or service, essentially "leaving" or canceling their subscription. In the context of the telecom industry (and other service industries), churn typically represents customers who stop using the company's services.
PROCESS & ANALYZE DATA USING PANDAS IN PYTHON.
Data preprocessing is an essential step to prepare the data for modeling. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset for training and testing. Here's a detailed guide on how to preprocess your Customer Churn Analysis data.

1. Churn Rate Percentage (Pie Chart - Top Left)
â€¢	This pie chart shows the proportion of customers who churned (left the company) vs those who did not churn.
â€¢	73.46% of customers stayed with the company (No), while 26.54% of customers churned (Yes).
â€¢	Insight:
The churn rate is moderate. About one-fourth of customers are leaving, which is a serious business concern but not extremely critical yet. Strategies are needed to reduce this.
________________________________________
2. Churn Distribution (Bar Chart - Top Right)
â€¢	This bar graph shows the number of customers who churned vs who didn't.
â€¢	Around 5174 customers did not churn, while 1869 customers churned.
â€¢	Insight:
It confirms the churn rate seen in the pie chart. There's a much larger number of loyal customers, but almost 1 in 4 customers is churning, which must be addressed.
________________________________________
3. Churn by Tenure Group (Bar Chart - Bottom Left)
â€¢	This graph shows the count of churned and non-churned customers based on their tenure (how many months they've been a customer).
â€¢	Tenure values range from 0 to 72 months.
â€¢	Observation:
o	Customers with very low tenure (0â€“5 months) have a high churn rate.
o	As tenure increases (customers who have stayed longer), churn decreases.
â€¢	Insight:
New customers are more likely to leave early if they are dissatisfied initially.
Longer-tenured customers are more loyal.
So, early-stage customer experience is crucial.
________________________________________
4. Customer Churn Count by Gender (Bar Chart - Bottom Right)
â€¢	This bar chart compares churn counts across genders (Male and Female).
â€¢	Observation:
o	Female: 2549 stayed, 939 churned.
o	Male: 2625 stayed, 930 churned.
â€¢	Insight:
Churn rate is quite similar between genders.
This suggests gender is not a strong differentiating factor in churn behavior for this company.
 
Customer Churn Count by SeniorCitizen
â€¢	The graph shows churn distribution based on whether the customer is a senior citizen or not.
â€¢	Two groups:   No â†’ Not a senior citizen                     Yes â†’ Senior citizen
Observation:
â€¢	Among non-senior citizens:
o	4508 customers stayed.
o	1393 customers churned.
â€¢	Among senior citizens:
o	666 customers stayed.
o	476 customers churned.
Insights:
â€¢	Senior citizens have a higher churn rate compared to non-senior citizens.
â€¢	Although the total number of senior citizens is smaller, their churn percentage is higher.
â€¢	Non-senior citizens are more likely to stay.
ðŸ”µ Simple interpretation:
Senior citizens seem less loyal and more likely to leave the telecom company than younger customers.
 
Customer Churn Count by Partner	
â€¢	This bar chart shows churn behavior based on whether the customer has a partner (spouse) or not.
â€¢	Two groups:      Yes â†’ Has a partner              No â†’ Does not have a partner
Observation:
â€¢	Customers with a partner:
o	2733 stayed.
o	669 churned.
â€¢	Customers without a partner:
o	2441 stayed.
o	1200 churned.
Insights:
â€¢	Customers without a partner have a higher churn rate compared to those with a partner.
â€¢	Having a partner seems to be associated with higher loyalty and lower likelihood of churn.
Simple interpretation: Customers who are single or without a partner are more likely to churn than those who have a partner.

Tenure Distribution by Churn Status:
 
â€¢	This boxplot shows the distribution of tenure (months with the company) for customers who churned (Yes) and did not churn (No).
Observation:	
â€¢	Non-churned customers (No):
o	Median tenure is around 38 months.
o	Most customers stayed between 15 to 60+ months.
â€¢	Churned customers (Yes):
o	Median tenure is around 10 months.
o	Most churned within the first 0â€“30 months.
o	A few customers with longer tenure (>60 months) still churned (seen as outliers).
Insights:
â€¢	Customers who have shorter tenures are much more likely to churn.
â€¢	Longer-tenured customers are more loyal and less likely to leave.
â€¢	Early-stage customers (new users) are a critical group for churn prevention strategies.
ðŸ”µ Simple Interpretation:   The longer a customer stays, the less likely they are to churn.
Newer customers need more attention to reduce early churn.
Churn by Tenure Categories:  Correlation Heatmap:
 
â€¢	The x-axis represents the Churn status (No or Yes).
â€¢	The y-axis represents tenure buckets (in months): 0-12, 12-24, 24-36, 36-48, 48-60, and 60+.
â€¢	The numbers inside the cells represent the count of customers in each group.
Observation:   In the 0â€“12 months group:
o	Churners (Yes) are 1037, almost as high as non-churners (No) 1138.
o	âž” Very high churn risk among newer customers.
â€¢	As tenure increases:
o	The number of churners steadily decreases.
o	For example, in 60+ months, only 93 customers churned compared to 1314 non-churners.
â€¢	From 24 months onwards, churners become significantly fewer than non-churners.
Insights:
â€¢	Majority of churn happens early, especially within the first 12 months.
â€¢	Customers staying longer than 2 years have a much lower churn rate.
Simple Interpretation:  New customers are much more vulnerable to churn.
Retention efforts should focus heavily on customers in their first year.
Customer Count by Contract Type: 
 
â€¢	The bars are split by Churn status (No in red, yes in blue).
â€¢	The numbers above the bars indicate count of customers in each group.
Key Observations:
â€¢	Month-to-Month contracts:
o	Very high churn (Yes: 1655 customers) compared to churn in One year or Two year contracts.
o	Also, non-churners are many (2220), but churn rate is higher here.
â€¢	One-year contracts:
o	Much fewer churners (166) compared to non-churners (1307).
o	Churn rate significantly drops compared to month-to-month.
â€¢	Two-year contracts:
o	Lowest churn (only 48 customers churned vs 1647 who stayed).
o	Customers with two-year contracts are most loyal.

Simple Interpretation:   Customers with short-term (month-to-month) contracts churn a lot more.
Longer commitments like one-year or two-year contracts greatly reduce churn.

Countplots :
 
Each plot is a countplot that compares a service feature (like PhoneService, OnlineBackup, etc.) with Customer Churn (Yes or No).
â€¢	X-axis: Shows the category of the service feature (example: Yes/No for Phone Service).
â€¢	Y-axis: Shows the number of customers (count) in that category.
â€¢	Hue (color): Splits the customers based on whether they churned or not:
o	Red color â†’ Customers who did not churn (Churn = No)
o	Blue color â†’ Customers who churned (Churn = Yes)
