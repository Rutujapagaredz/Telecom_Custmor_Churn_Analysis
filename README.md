                                                 AIM
Customer acquisition costs are high in the telecom industry, making it far more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to attract new ones. Churn not only results in direct revenue loss but also affects long-term brand reputation and market competitiveness. By understanding the reasons why customers leave, telecom companies can take targeted actions—such as personalized offers, service improvements, or proactive support—to retain valuable customers.
This study is essential because:
•	It helps identify patterns and risk factors associated with churn.
•	It supports data-driven decision-making for customer retention strategies.
•	It enables the prediction of future churn, allowing companies to act before a customer actually leaves.
•	It improves overall customer experience and satisfaction, leading to long-term profitability.
The aim of this project is to analyze customer data from a telecom company to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn, and to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify customers at risk of leaving. The insights gained will support strategic decision-making to enhance customer retention and reduce churn rates.


                                        OBJECTIVE 
1.	To explore and understand customer demographics and service usage patterns using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2.	To calculate churn rates across different customer segments such as contract types, payment methods, and internet services.
3.	To identify key features influencing customer churn through statistical analysis and visualization techniques.
4.	To build predictive machine learning models that classify whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
5.	To evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6.	To provide actionable insights and recommendations that telecom companies can use to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

                                        DATASET
The dataset used for this project is based on customer information from a telecom company, providing data on customer demographics, account details, services subscribed, and whether or not the customer churned (left the company).
Dataset Details:
•	Source: Telco Customer Churn dataset (often publicly available).
•	Number of Records: 7,043 customers.
•	Features: 21 columns in total.
Key Columns:
1.	customerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
2.	gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
3.	SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (Yes/No).
4.	Partner: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes/No).
5.	Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes/No).
6.	tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
7.	PhoneService: Whether the customer has phone service (Yes/No).
8.	MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes/No).
9.	InternetService: Type of internet service the customer uses (DSL/Fiber optic/No).
10.	OnlineSecurity: Whether the customer has online security (Yes/No).
11.	OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has online backup (Yes/No).
12.	DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has device protection (Yes/No).
13.	TechSupport: Whether the customer has tech support (Yes/No).
14.	StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV (Yes/No).
15.	StreamingMovies: Whether the customer has streaming movies (Yes/No).
16.	Contract: Type of contract the customer has (Month-to-month/One year/Two year).
17.	PaperlessBilling: Whether the customer has paperless billing (Yes/No).
18.	PaymentMethod: The payment method used by the customer (Electronic check/Bank transfer/Etc.).
19.	MonthlyCharges: The monthly charge for the customer’s account.
20.	TotalCharges: Total charges billed to the customer.
21.	Churn: The target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (Yes) or stayed (No).
Data Type:
•	Categorical Variables: Most variables are categorical (e.g., gender, Contract, Churn).
•	Numerical Variables: tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges.
CHURN: Churn refers to the phenomenon where a customer discontinues their relationship with a company or service, essentially "leaving" or canceling their subscription. In the context of the telecom industry (and other service industries), churn typically represents customers who stop using the company's services.
PROCESS & ANALYZE DATA USING PANDAS IN PYTHON.
Data preprocessing is an essential step to prepare the data for modeling. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset for training and testing. Here's a detailed guide on how to preprocess your Customer Churn Analysis data.
